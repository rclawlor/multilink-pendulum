1) model based training plot is incorrectly titled; it uses the same environment as model free, but the MBPO agent introduces a model
2) although model based has lower reward, its performance is the same; the lower reward is because the time-dependent bonus reward is not included in its reward function (I mistook this difference for model bias at first, but doesn't actually mean anything)
3) MBPO agent in model based uses 10% "real" and 90% rollout data for learning; the episodes counted on the x-axis are only the real ones
4) real episodes are used to train the MBPO agent (system identification); the architecture of the neural network used here is the same as of the neural network we use to train the dynamics with motor babbling
